Yo, nice to see you there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is the github repo containing the source code of the random Spotify song picker you're probably coming from. ðŸ”¥

If you're interested in creating your own lambda using this one as a template, don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions you may have.   
I'll be happy to help! ðŸ¤“

Anyway, I'm off to work now! ðŸŒ´ðŸ”¨ðŸ¥¥
