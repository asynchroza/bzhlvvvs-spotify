Yo, nice to see you there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is the github repo containing the source code of the random Spotify song picker you're probably coming from. ðŸ”¥

If you're interested in creating your own lambda using this one as a template, don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions you may have.   
I'll be happy to help! ðŸ¤“

Anyway, I'm off to work now! ðŸŒ´ðŸ”¨ðŸ¥¥

## Environment Variables:

Before running or deploying the lambda, you need to create a copy of the sample env file called `.env.spotify` and place it 
in the `src` directory:
```shell
cp src/.env.sample src/.env.spotify
```

* `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are the corresponding client id and client secret of your spotify app. The lambda 
is using [client credentials flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/client-credentials-flow) for authorizing towards Spotify's API. (**REQUIRED**)

* `TITLE` is the title you want the generated static page to have. (**REQUIRED**)

* `FAVICON_URL` is the url pointing to the location of your favicon. If left empty, your page won't have a favicon. 
```bash
FAVICON_URL="https://personal-misho.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/favicon.ico"  # I am using an S3 bucket to host my favicon
```

* `PLAYLIST_ID` is the id of the playlist you want to fetch songs from. (**REQUIRED**)  
To obtain the ID of your playlist, you can click on the three dots icon located next to your playlist. Then, copy the URL of the playlist:
