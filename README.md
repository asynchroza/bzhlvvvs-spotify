# course-recommendation-service

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These
resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to
add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

If you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to build and test your application,
you can use the AWS Toolkit.  
The AWS Toolkit is an open source plug-in for popular IDEs that uses the SAM CLI to build and deploy
serverless applications on AWS. The AWS Toolkit also adds a simplified step-through debugging
experience for Lambda function code. See the following links to get started.

- [PyCharm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-jetbrains/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
- [VS Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/welcome.html)

## Deploy the sample application

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

- SAM CLI -
  [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Docker -
  [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

To build and deploy your application, run the following in your shell:

```bash
yarn aws:deploy
```

You can find your API Gateway Endpoint URL in the output values displayed after deployment.

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build --use-container` command.

```bash
course-recommendation-service$ sam build --use-container
```

The SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` to run the API
locally on port 3000.

```bash
course-recommendation-service$ sam local start-api
course-recommendation-service$ curl http://localhost:3000/{endpoint}
```

## Add a resource to your application

The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application
resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring
common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not
included in
[the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md),
you can use standard
[AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)
resource types.

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs
generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs
on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
course-recommendation-service$ sam logs -n {functionName} --stack-name "course-recommendation-service" --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the
[SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the test dependencies
and run tests.

```bash
course-recommendation-service$ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt --user
# unit test
course-recommendation-service$ python -m pytest tests/unit -v
# integration test, requiring deploying the stack first.
# Create the env variable AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME with the name of the stack we are testing
course-recommendation-service$ AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME="course-recommendation-service" python -m pytest tests/integration -v
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project
name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
sam delete --stack-name "course-recommendation-service"
```

## Resources

See the
[AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)
for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond
hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications:
